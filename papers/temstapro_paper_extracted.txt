ABSTRACT

Motivation:
Protein thermostability is crucial for biotechnological applications. Current computational methods for predicting protein thermostability often rely on structural information or complex feature engineering, limiting their applicability.

Results:
We present TemStaPro, a method for predicting protein thermostability using sequence representations from protein language models (pLMs). TemStaPro uses embeddings from ESM-2 and ProtTrans models to train binary classifiers for multiple temperature thresholds (30°C to 90°C). We created the TemStaPro dataset containing over 100,000 protein sequences with thermostability annotations.

Key Performance Results:
- Maximum MCC score: 0.903 (80°C threshold)
- Practical utility MCC scores: 0.805 (60°C), 0.811 (65°C)
- Outperformed existing methods: BertThermo, ProLaTherm, SAPPHIRE, DeepTP, iThermo

METHODOLOGY

Data Preparation:
- TemStaPro-Major-30 dataset: >100,000 sequences
- Temperature thresholds: 30°C, 35°C, 40°C, 45°C, 50°C, 55°C, 60°C, 65°C, 70°C, 75°C, 80°C, 85°C, 90°C
- Sequence identity filtering: <30% similarity to avoid overfitting
- Balanced and imbalanced test sets for evaluation

Protein Language Models:
- ESM-2 (650M parameters): Mean embeddings from transformer layers
- ProtTrans ProtT5-XL: Pre-trained on UniRef50 database
- Embedding dimensions: 1280 (ESM-2), 1024 (ProtT5-XL)

Binary Classifier Design:
- Architecture: Simple feedforward neural networks
- Input: pLM embeddings (mean-pooled)
- Output: Binary classification (thermostable/non-thermostable)
- Training: Cross-validation with hyperparameter optimization

RESULTS

Performance Metrics (Balanced Test Set):

40°C                 | 0.756     | 0.878    | 0.878    | 0.943
50°C                 | 0.779     | 0.890    | 0.890    | 0.951
60°C                 | 0.805     | 0.902    | 0.902    | 0.960
65°C                 | 0.811     | 0.906    | 0.906    | 0.962
70°C                 | 0.825     | 0.913    | 0.913    | 0.967
80°C                 | 0.903     | 0.951    | 0.951    | 0.986
90°C                 | 0.876     | 0.938    | 0.938    | 0.979

Comparison with Other Methods:
- BertThermo: Best competing method, consistently outperformed by TemStaPro
- ProLaTherm: Lower performance across all thresholds
- SAPPHIRE: Outperformed by TemStaPro for 60°C-70°C thresholds
- DeepTP: Lower performance on iThermo benchmark
- iThermo: Baseline method, significantly outperformed

Key Findings:
1. ESM-2 embeddings generally outperformed ProtT5-XL embeddings
2. Mean-pooled embeddings were most effective
3. Performance peaked around 70°C-80°C thresholds
4. Method generalizes well to independent test datasets
5. No structural information required - sequence-only prediction

DISCUSSION

Advantages:
- Sequence-only input (no structural information needed)
- Multiple temperature thresholds
- High accuracy and generalization
- Fast prediction (seconds per protein)
- Available as web tool and software package

Limitations:
- Binary classification only (not continuous temperature prediction)
- Performance varies by temperature threshold
- Requires large training datasets
- Limited to proteins with known thermostability data

Applications:
- Protein engineering for thermostability
- Industrial enzyme optimization
- Biotechnology applications
- Drug discovery and development

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR REGRESSION TASK:
The original TemStaPro performs BINARY CLASSIFICATION (thermostable vs non-thermostable) rather than CONTINUOUS TEMPERATURE PREDICTION. Our implementation attempts regression to predict actual temperature values, which is a more challenging task.

Expected Performance Comparison:
- Original TemStaPro: 80-95% accuracy for binary classification
- Our regression approach: MAE should target <15°C for good performance
- Current results (~35°C MAE) suggest need for:
  * Larger training datasets
  * More training epochs
  * Better hyperparameter tuning
  * Possibly different loss functions (Huber loss)
  * Data preprocessing improvements
